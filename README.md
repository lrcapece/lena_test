## Git workflow

This workflow has 4 primary spaces: Workspace, Staging index, Local repository, Remote repository, where pushing, pulling and are necessary.

1)  Make a public respository on Github
2)  Clone that repository to your local environment by Copying the URL
3)  Open a new project on Rstudio select "Version Control" and Paste the URL. Hit "Create Project"
4)  You should now have all files associated with the Github and the one you created on Rstudio
